### Circle Survival is arcade survival game.

#### The gameplay involves tapping the circles that appear.
Each circle is a bomb - we have a limited time to tap it (defuse). If we do not tap the circle in time - we lose. Successful tap on the circle causes its removal (neutralization). During the game, the circles spawn faster and faster and they have less and less time to explode (in that the level of difficulty increases and you can not play indefinitely).
